# Maven-Market-Dashbord-project

In the Maven Market Dashboard project, I began by importing and cleaning various datasets. Afterward, I enriched the data by adding essential DAX measures and calculated columns to enhance analysis capabilities. I established logical relationships among calendar, customer, product, region, returns, store, and transaction date data. The dashboard was then crafted with key performance indicators (KPIs), including current month transactions, total profit, and overall returns.

A matrix table was incorporated to showcase product brands, their total transactions, profit margins, and return rates, providing a comprehensive overview. A tree map visualization was integrated, offering a visual representation of data distribution. The gauge chart compared revenue against the target, aiding in performance assessment. Additionally, a bar chart displayed weekly revenue trends, allowing insights into fluctuations over time.

For geographical insights, a map was employed to illustrate revenue distribution by country. This Maven Market Dashboard presents a user-friendly way to explore transaction dynamics, profit margins, returns, and geographical patterns, using a variety of visuals and metrics for informed decision-making.

### Objective

>What are the values of current month's transactions, total profits, and total returns in the dashboard?
